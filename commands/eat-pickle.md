# Stop Pickle Rick Loop

Stopping the autonomous loop...

!`bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/stop-loop.sh`

## Loop Terminated

The Pickle Rick autonomous loop has been stopped.

**Summary:**
- The current iteration will complete
- No further iterations will be started
- Progress made so far is preserved

If you want to resume work on this task later, you can start a new loop with `/pickle`.
